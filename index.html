        TickyBot is a Slack Bot ü§ñ that lets you use support tickets on 
        Slack. This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel

        With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets, change their status, 
        or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly update itself on our site.
